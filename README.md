It's connects to NASA and Spacex API's, fetch images and public it (or any other images) in telegram channel.

## How to install


Python3 should already be installed. Use pip (or pip3, if there is a conflict with Python2) to install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

For using you need your TOKEN from [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/#apod)

Also you need TOKEN for your [Bot in telegram](https://way23.ru/%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B3%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F-%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0-%D0%B2-telegram.html)

You should use environment variables. Create file name `.env` and variables `NASA_TOKEN` and `TG_BOT_TOKEN` in the root directory.
In file `.env` only two line:

```
NASA_TOKEN='here is your own TOKEN'
TG_BOT_TOKEN='here is your own TOKEN'
```

Example for command line:

```
$ python '\Images_in_telegram\main.py' 3600 123456789
```

Where `3600` - time in seconds between publications. The default time is 4 hours.

And `'123456789'`- ID chat in telegram, where images will be send. Default it's `'@space_view'`.
